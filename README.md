NEVER use BLANKS in directories, filenames, paths and names of problems in program DiInSo.
It is highly recommended to install DiInSo in root directory of any logical disk.
If you have any error messages at program start, try to install 'Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015' from Microsoft internet site or from directory 'redist'.
At that moment only RUSSIAN full documentation of DiInSo available, but interface and hints of program on ENGLISH language. ENGLISH full documentation will be available later.
DiInSo now in early pre-release beta-mode, so be ready to small, middle, big and even critical errors. If you help as testers, we will fix bugs together. ;)
Be patient and thank you for understanding.
