// Is it necessary output symmetrix matrix in text special CSR-like (Compact Sparse Row) format with one-dimensional arrays in files
   (this format usually using for analysis):
di.txt - diagonal elements;
ggl.txt - data of non-zero low-triangle elements of matrix;
igc.txt - igc[0] = 0, igc[i] = igc[i - 1] + (number of non-zero elements on the i-th row in the low-triangle), rows numbering from 0;
jgc.txt - contains the column indexes in low-triangle of each non-zero element of low triangle, columns numbering from 0.
1 - YES, 0 - NO.
P.S. By default (and always) matrix output in binary format (matr.dat) and popular Matrix Market format (matr.mtx): http://networkrepository.com/mtx-matrix-market-format.html
