// FIRST STRING - name of the folder with results (name of problem) for the first experiment;
// SECOND STRING - name of the folder with results (name of problem) for the second experiment;
// P.S.: As an experiment, for example, there may be a problem where in the first case 
         the search object is absent, and in the second case the search object is present.
         After evaluating the estimation results, you can make a preliminary conclusion about
         the effectiveness of an appropriate array for the search of an appropriate object.
