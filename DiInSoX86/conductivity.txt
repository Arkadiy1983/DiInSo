// The electrical conductivity is given as follows:
<number of electrical conductivities>
<NULL (for zero material (environment)) 0 electrical conductivity> - DO NOT FORGET that the numbering comes from ZERO
<electrical conductivity of material (environment) 1>
<electrical conductivity of material (environment) 2>
...
<electrical conductivity of material (environment) n>

IMPORTANT NOTE: If there are NO materials (environments) with specific numbers, you can set any value in these positions, but ignore these values NOT allowed!
