// Conductivities (Sm/m) in such form:
<number of conductivities>
<NULL-conductivity (for environment number 0)> - DO NOT FORGET, THAT NUMERATION FROM 0
<conductivity for 1 environment>
<conductivity for 2 environment>
...
<conductivity for n environment>
If model DO NOT has some environment numbers, you can enter ANY value in this positions, but you CAN'T ignore them!
